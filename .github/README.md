>  How companies break accessibility principles

## About
"Issues" is a [a11y.rocks](https://a11y.rocks) project that showcases accessibility issues with web apps.

On the web platform, technologies and guidelines have been built so we can build a web that includes everyone. By analysing how companies still break accessibility nowadays, our motivation is to educate people on understanding and applying the [**Four Principles of Accessibility**](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/intro.html#introduction-fourprincs-head).

## Why?
The web is an increasingly important resource in many aspects of life: education, employment, government, commerce, health care, recreation, and more. ([Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php))

**We all benefit from an inclusive web.** An accessible web is flexible to people's conditions, so everyone holds equal access to information and equal opportunity to participate in society.
