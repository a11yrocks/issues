CNN uses a third-party share utility. When using VoiceOver, is impossible for the user to know which share option is selected, because the only thing VoiceOver reads is "Table start", due the poor HTML semantic used in the third party widget. [Click here to check the HTML structure](https://gist.github.com/AgtLucas/a3295896ea6604886ab7e4807f3c95e3).

* Hardware: iPhone 7 (iOS 11.0.3).
* Software: Safari with VoiceOver enabled.
