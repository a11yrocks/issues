Snapchat's website is useless when it comes to understanding the app itself. There is even less information for a screen reader user, because no alternative content is provided for the logo image, for instance.

That violates completely the [Understandable principle of accessibility](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Understandable) (mainly Guideline 3.1). It's also related to the [Perceivable principle](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable).
