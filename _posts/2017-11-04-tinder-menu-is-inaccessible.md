Tinder's website menu is impossible to use with the keyboard.

1. It's confusing: it doesn't follow a logical order when using the keyboard to navigate through it.
2. Because it's visually hidden but still operable, the menu allows you to focus on links that are not shown on screen, which makes the keyboard navigation impossible to understand.
